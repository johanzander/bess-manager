# Changelog

All notable changes to BESS Battery Manager will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.5.7] - 2025-11-10

### Fixed

- Fixed critical bug where invalid estimatedConsumption field in battery settings prevented all settings from being applied
- Fixed settings failures silently continuing with defaults instead of failing explicitly
- Currency and other user configuration now properly applied on startup

### Changed

- Settings application now fails fast with clear error message when configuration is invalid
- Removed estimatedConsumption from internal battery settings (now computed on-demand for API responses only)

## [2.5.5] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- Fixed initial_cost_basis returning 0.0 when battery at reserved capacity, causing irrational grid charging at high prices
- Fixed settings not updating from config.yaml due to camelCase/snake_case mismatch in update() methods
- Fixed dict-ordering bug where max_discharge_power_kw would be overwritten by max_charge_power_kw depending on key order
- Added explicit AttributeError for invalid setting keys instead of silent failures

### Changed

- Settings classes now convert camelCase API keys to snake_case attributes automatically
- Removed silent hasattr() checks in favor of explicit error handling
- Added Git Commit Policy to CLAUDE.md documentation

## [2.5.4] - 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- Fixed test mode to properly block all hardware write operations using "deny by default" pattern

- Removed unused ac_power sensor configuration

### Changed

- Test mode now controlled via HA_TEST_MODE environment variable instead of hardcoded
- Updated docker-compose.yml to mount root config.yaml for development

## [2.5.3] - 2025-11-06

### Fixed

- Fixed HACS/GitHub repository installation by restructuring to single add-on layout
- Moved add-on configuration files (config.yaml, Dockerfile, build.json, DOCS.md) to repository root
- Removed unnecessary bess_manager/ subdirectory (proper for single add-on repositories)
- Dockerfile now correctly references backend/, core/, and frontend/ from repository root
- Build context is now repository root, allowing direct access to all source directories

## [2.5.2] - 2024-11-06
