# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
this repository. Read `docs/agents/rules.md` first — those constraints are
non-negotiable and apply to all agents.

## Verification Before Action

- ALWAYS run tests locally before pushing commits — never push to any remote until local tests are green
- ALWAYS verify against actual source code/repos before making assumptions about APIs, entity names, or naming patterns
- NEVER speculate about file contents or behavior - read the file or run the code first
- Before proposing any fix, show the exact code path and evidence (logs, source) that proves the root cause — do not guess at entity names, prefixes, or discovery logic

## Project Overview

BESS Manager is a Home Assistant add-on for optimizing battery energy storage
systems. It provides price-based optimization, solar integration, and a web
interface for managing battery schedules and monitoring energy flows.

## Development Commands

### Backend (Python)

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest -m "not slow"           # fast tests (~3s, recommended)
.venv/bin/pytest -m slow                 # algorithm/integration tests (~30min)
.venv/bin/pytest                         # run all tests
.venv/bin/black . && .venv/bin/ruff check --fix .  # format and lint
./scripts/quality-check.sh               # full quality gate
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev          # development server
npm run build        # production build
npm run lint:fix     # fix TypeScript issues
npm run generate-api # regenerate API client from OpenAPI spec
```

### Docker Development

```bash
docker-compose up -d                                          # backend + frontend (dev)
docker compose -f docker-compose.ci.yml up -d                 # E2E dev with mock-HA (fast, volume mounts)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod-test.yml up -d --build  # production image smoke test
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Build Add-on

```bash
./package-addon.sh
```

## Architecture in One Paragraph

FastAPI backend (`backend/app.py`) runs an hourly scheduler. The core
optimization engine (`core/bess/`) uses dynamic programming to generate a
24-hour battery schedule from electricity spot prices and real-time sensor
data. The schedule is sent to a Growatt inverter via the Home Assistant API.
A React SPA (`frontend/`) provides the management interface.

## Automated Agent Workflow

GitHub issues flow through a four-stage pipeline. Each stage is a separate
workflow file with a self-contained prompt — there is no cross-stage routing
through CLAUDE.md. All stages run on `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`.

| Stage | Trigger | Workflow | Cost | What it does |
|-------|---------|----------|------|--------------|
| 1. Triage | `issues: opened/edited` (auto) | `issue-triage.yml` | ~$0.05 | Classify + label only. Gates on debug log presence. |
| 2. Analyze | `@claude-bot analyze` (manual) | `issue-analyze.yml` | ~$0.50–2 | Delegates to `bess-analyst` sub-agent, posts root-cause diagnosis. No code changes. |
| 3. Fix | `@claude-bot fix` (manual) | `issue-fix.yml` | ~$1–4 | Implements minimal fix per Stage 2 plan, runs `quality-check.sh`, opens draft PR. |
| 4. Review | `@claude-bot` on a PR (manual) | `pr-review.yml` | ~$0.50–2 | Reviews diff against rules and checklist. |
| 5. Integrate | `@claude-bot integrate` (manual) | `issue-integrate.yml` | ~$2–10 | Drives a new inverter/provider request through the full experimental→stable lifecycle (`feature-lifecycle`), one stage per invocation. |

**Why gated, not auto:** Stages 2 and 3 cost real money. The user explicitly
triggers each one after reading the previous stage's output.

**Label flow:**

```
opened ──► bug + needs-debug-log     (Stage 1: no log)
            │
            └─ user adds log ──► bug + ready-for-analysis  (Stage 1 re-runs on edit)
                                  │
                  @claude-bot analyze
                                  ▼
                                  analyzed                 (Stage 2)
                                  │
                  @claude-bot fix
                                  ▼
                                  has-fix-pr               (Stage 3, draft PR open)
```

If Stage 2 can't reach a conclusion it applies `needs-human-review` instead
of `analyzed`.

### General bot rules

- Only the repo owner can trigger bot commands.
- Always use `gh` CLI for all GitHub operations (issues, PRs, labels).
- Never push directly to `main`. PRs are always opened as drafts.
- The bot identity is `bess-manager-claude-bot` (a custom GitHub App). The
  official Anthropic Claude App is **suspended** to avoid collisions —
  do not unsuspend it.
- Stage 2 must invoke the `bess-analyst` sub-agent. Skipping that step is
  the failure mode the previous design suffered from.

## Release Workflow

- Always release through a PR so CI runs — never push directly to a branch bypassing CI
- Always check the current published version before tagging (e.g., check GitHub releases) to avoid version collisions
- Confirm the target remote and branch BEFORE pushing releases (beta vs main, origin vs beta remote)
- Run the full test suite locally before any release tag or beta push
- Never skip the CHANGELOG.md update or version bump

## Scope Discipline

- Do NOT modify, remove, or 'clean up' items the user hasn't asked you to change
- When doing cleanup, list what you plan to change and confirm before editing
- Do not revert intentional linter changes or simplifications without explicit instruction
- After editing, list every file and symbol changed so the user can confirm nothing unrelated was touched
- Never add speculative fallbacks, defensive error handling, or "robustness" improvements beyond what was asked

## Cost Discipline

The user pays per token. A long Opus session that re-reads a large context after
every multi-minute wait is what runs up the bill — not the work itself.

- **Default to Sonnet** (set in `.claude/settings.json`). Use Opus only for a
  genuinely hard reasoning step, say so, and drop back. Don't run routine
  coordination, iteration, CI-watching, or file edits on Opus.
- **Never spawn Opus subagents**, and avoid agents for long-running watches
  entirely; if delegation is truly needed, use a cheap model.
- **Don't hold one big session across many long CI/test waits.** The prompt
  cache expires after ~5 min, so each long wait forces a full uncached re-read
  of the entire context. Prefer `/clear` between unrelated chunks, or let the
  session sit idle rather than re-engaging every few minutes.
- Don't re-dump large files or logs into context.
- **Treat `implement-issue` Step 8 (`verify`, podman-compose/mock-HA E2E) as
  a session boundary.** Kick it off, then either let the session sit idle
  until it completes or `/clear` and resume fresh once it's done — don't
  stay engaged re-touching the diagnosis/TDD context through the wait.

## Worktree Conventions

Both layouts are first-class — either way the worktree is a normal git checkout,
so per-agent inspect / test / run (`./deploy.sh`, `pytest`, the app) works the
same. Choose by how you want to reach an agent's work:

- **Sibling folders** (e.g. `../bess-manager-feature/`) — open cleanly in their
  own VS Code window; this is the go-to when you actively inspect code and run
  scripts per agent. They work with Agent View too: start the background session
  *inside* the sibling (it's a linked git worktree, so Claude won't relocate it).
  Caveat: a sibling only appears in **unscoped** `claude agents` (or
  `--cwd ~/GitHub`), not in the project-scoped `claude agents --cwd <repo>` view.
- **Native `.claude/worktrees/`** (`claude agents` / `--worktree` /
  `EnterWorktree`) — auto-created for background sessions and visible in the
  **project-scoped** Agent View. Still a real checkout: `code
  <repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>` or `cd` into it to run tests/scripts.

Find any session's worktree path by peeking/attaching it in Agent View, or via
`claude agents --json` (the `cwd` field).
