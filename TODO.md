**Economic Impact**: Significant - enables optimal charging/discharging decisions that span multiple days

## ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH PRIORITY** (Core Functionality)

### 1. **Improve Battery SOC and Actions Component**

**Impact**: Medium-High | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Backend cost calculations

**Description**: Core feature enhancement showing detailed battery optimization reasoning

**Current State**: `BatteryLevelChart` shows basic SOC but lacks prediction breakdown

**Implementation**:

- **Add actual/predicted timeline split** with visual distinction
- **Add detailed cost breakdown table**:

```text
  Base case cost:     65.69 SEK (Actual: 27.06 + Predicted: 38.63)
  Grid cost:         -14.90 SEK (Actual: 28.13 + Predicted: -43.03)
  Battery wear cost:   9.89 SEK (Actual: 2.60 + Predicted: 7.29)
  Total savings:      80.59 SEK (Actual: -1.07 + Predicted: 81.67)
```

**Technical Tasks**:

- Update `BatteryLevelChart.tsx` for actual/predicted split
- Create cost breakdown table component
- Add hover tooltips with detailed calculations
- Integrate with backend hourly cost data

### 3. **Move Relevant Parts of Daily Summary to Dashboard**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low-Medium | **Dependencies**: Dashboard layout

**Current State**: `SavingsPage` contains energy independence metrics that belong on Dashboard

**Implementation**:

- **Extract Energy Independence Card**: Self-sufficiency %, Grid independence time, Solar utilization %
- **Remove duplicates**: Eliminate redundant cost/savings between Dashboard and Savings pages

**Technical Tasks**:

- Create `EnergyIndependenceCard.tsx` component
- Extract logic from `SavingsPage.tsx`
- Add to `DashboardPage.tsx`
- Remove duplicate information

### 5. **Enhance Insights Page with Decision Detail**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Backend decision logging

**Current State**: Only shows high-level intent, lacks decision reasoning

**Implementation**:

- **Add detailed decision analysis**: Why each battery action was chosen
- **Algorithm transparency**: DP optimization steps, price arbitrage reasoning
- **Alternative scenarios**: Options considered, confidence metrics

**Technical Tasks**:

- Extend backend to capture decision reasoning
- Create decision timeline component
- Add interactive decision trees
- Include confidence metrics display

---

### 6. **Demo Mode for Users Without Configured Sensors**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Backend architecture, Mock data

**Description**: Allow users to run and explore the system without requiring fully configured Home Assistant sensors. This enables evaluation, development, and troubleshooting scenarios.

**Implementation**:

- **Enhanced mock data generation**: Create realistic synthetic energy data, battery states, and pricing
- **Demo mode toggle**: Configuration option to enable full demo mode vs partial sensor availability
- **Graceful degradation**: System operates with missing sensors using reasonable defaults
- **Demo data scenarios**: Multiple realistic scenarios (high solar, EV charging, peak pricing days)
- **Visual indicators**: Clear UI indication when running in demo/mock mode

**Benefits**: Users can evaluate the system before full HA integration, developers can test without hardware, easier onboarding experience

**Technical Tasks**:

- Extend existing test mode functionality in `ha_api_controller.py`
- Create comprehensive mock data generators for all sensor types
- Add demo mode configuration to `config.yaml`
- Update frontend to show demo mode indicators
- Ensure optimization algorithms work with mock data

## ðŸŸ¢ **LOW PRIORITY** (Polish)

### 7. Add Prediction accuracy and history

### 8. Intent is not always correct for historical data

**Current State**: The inverter sometimes charges/discharges small amounts like 0.1kW. Or its a rounding error or inefficiencies losses when calculating flows. I don't think its a strategic intent, but it is interpreted as one.

### 9. Add multi day view

**Problem**: Today we only operate on 24h intervals.
But at noon every day we get tomorrows schedule. We could use this information to take better economic decisions. It would mean changing a lot of places where 24h is hard coded.

## ðŸ”„ **ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS** (From Historical Design Analysis)

### 10. **Machine Learning Predictions**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Historical data, ML framework

**Description**: ML-based consumption and solar predictions to improve optimization accuracy beyond current HA sensor forecasts.

**Implementation**:

- Integrate with existing PredictionProvider framework
- Historical data analysis for pattern recognition (weather, season, usage patterns)
- Adaptive prediction models with confidence scoring
- Accuracy tracking and model performance metrics

### 11. **Performance Monitoring and Metrics**

**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Analytics framework

**Description**: Comprehensive performance tracking for optimization effectiveness and system reliability.

**Implementation**:

- Optimization accuracy tracking (predicted vs actual savings)
- Battery performance degradation monitoring
- Energy balance validation metrics and alerts
- Component timing and performance metrics collection
- Automated reporting and alerting for anomalies

### 12. **Data Export and Analysis Tools**

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Data stores

**Description**: Export capabilities for external analysis and system backup.

**Implementation**:

- JSON/CSV export of historical energy data and optimization decisions
- Configuration backup/restore functionality
- Optimization decision logs with reasoning export
- Integration with external analytics tools (Grafana, etc.)

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL DEBT**

### FormattingContext Architecture

**Impact**: Low | **Effort**: Low (45 min) | **Dependencies**: None

**Description**: Replace currency parameter passing with FormattingContext dataclass for better extensibility and i18n support.

**Current State**: Currency passed as string parameter through call chain

**Implementation**: Create frozen FormattingContext dataclass, update `create_formatted_value()` and dataclass `from_internal()` methods, modify API endpoints to create context from settings

**Benefits**: Type safety, extensibility for locale/timezone/precision without signature changes, future-proof for internationalization

**Files**: `backend/api_dataclasses.py`, `backend/api.py`

### Other Technical Debt

- Refactor all API endpoints to use dataclass-based serialization (with robust mapping for all field variants) for consistent, type-safe, and future-proof API responses. Ensure all details and fields are preserved as in the original dict-based implementation.
- Add power monitoring sensors to health check.
- Check if all sensors in config.yaml are actually needed and used (lifetime e.g.)
- Fix dark mode button

**Sensor Collector InfluxDB Usage**:
Based on the code analysis: The function `_get_hour_readings` in SensorCollector is called by `collect_energy_data(hour)`. This is not called every hour automatically by the system; it is called when the system wants to collect and record data for a specific hour. The actual historical data for the dashboard is served from the HistoricalDataStore, which is an in-memory store populated by calls to `record_energy_data` (which uses the output of `collect_energy_data`).

The `_get_hour_readings` (and thus the InfluxDB query) is called at startup (to reconstruct history) and whenever a new hour is completed and needs to be recorded. It is not called every hour by a scheduler, but it is called for each hour that needs to be reconstructed or recorded.
