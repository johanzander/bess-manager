# Energy Management System Improvements - Prioritized Implementation Plan



### 2. **Ensure No Code Uses Sensor Names Directly**
**Impact**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: Core system reliability

**Why Second**: Critical technical debt - direct sensor usage creates fragile coupling, hard to maintain

**Current State**: Code may reference HA sensor entity IDs directly instead of abstraction layer
- Risk of system breakage when sensors change
- Hard to reconfigure without code changes

**Technical Tasks**:
- Audit all `.py` files for direct sensor name references (search for `sensor.` patterns)
- Ensure all access uses `ha_api_controller.get_sensor_value(sensor_name)` 
- Update hardcoded entity IDs to use sensor configuration
- Add sensor validation and error handling
- Document sensor abstraction patterns

## ðŸŸ¡ **HIGH PRIORITY** (Core Functionality)

### 4. **Fix System Health Page**
**Impact**: Medium-High | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: System monitoring

Review which should be required and optional
test that missing sensors actually works

---

### 5. **Improve Battery SOC and Actions Component**
**Impact**: Medium-High | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Backend cost calculations

**Why Fifth**: Core feature enhancement showing detailed battery optimization reasoning

**Current State**: `BatteryLevelChart` shows basic SOC but lacks prediction breakdown

**Implementation**:
- **Add actual/predicted timeline split** with visual distinction
- **Add detailed cost breakdown table**:
  ```
  Base case cost:     65.69 SEK (Actual: 27.06 + Predicted: 38.63)
  Grid cost:         -14.90 SEK (Actual: 28.13 + Predicted: -43.03)  
  Battery wear cost:   9.89 SEK (Actual: 2.60 + Predicted: 7.29)
  Total savings:      80.59 SEK (Actual: -1.07 + Predicted: 81.67)
  ```

**Technical Tasks**:
- Update `BatteryLevelChart.tsx` for actual/predicted split
- Create cost breakdown table component
- Add hover tooltips with detailed calculations
- Integrate with backend hourly cost data

---

### 7. **Move Relevant Parts of Daily Summary to Dashboard**
**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Low-Medium | **Dependencies**: Dashboard layout

**Current State**: `SavingsPage` contains energy independence metrics that belong on Dashboard

**Implementation**:
- **Extract Energy Independence Card**: Self-sufficiency %, Grid independence time, Solar utilization %
- **Remove duplicates**: Eliminate redundant cost/savings between Dashboard and Savings pages

**Technical Tasks**:
- Create `EnergyIndependenceCard.tsx` component
- Extract logic from `SavingsPage.tsx`
- Add to `DashboardPage.tsx`
- Remove duplicate information

---

### 8. **Fix Inverter Page Visual Style**
**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Dependencies**: UI consistency

**Current State**: InverterPage doesn't match dashboard visual design

**Technical Tasks**:
- Apply dashboard-style card layouts
- Use consistent color scheme and spacing
- Fix mobile responsiveness
- Match typography patterns

---

### 9. **Enhance Insights Page with Decision Detail** 
**Impact**: Medium | **Effort**: High | **Dependencies**: Backend decision logging

**Current State**: Only shows high-level intent, lacks decision reasoning

**Implementation**:
- **Add detailed decision analysis**: Why each battery action was chosen
- **Algorithm transparency**: DP optimization steps, price arbitrage reasoning
- **Alternative scenarios**: Options considered, confidence metrics

**Technical Tasks**:
- Extend backend to capture decision reasoning
- Create decision timeline component
- Add interactive decision trees
- Include confidence metrics display

## ðŸŸ¢ **LOW PRIORITY** (Polish)

### 11. **Move and consolidate all types and data fetching in frontend**

**Current State**: Each component fetches it's own data, while there is basically only one endpoint (/api/dashboard). Could we centralize this to make cleaner code. Also there is an energy endpoint we've removed where we are still recreating the old data structures - this could be removed. 

### 12. Add Prediction accuracy and history

### 13 Intent is not always correct for historical data. 

**Current State**: The inverter sometimes charges/discharges small amounts like 0.1kW. Or its a rounding error or inefficiencies losses when calculating flows. I don't think its a strategic intent, but it is interpreted as one.

### 14 Add multi day view.

*** Problem ***: Today we only operate on 24h intervals.
But at noon every day we get tomorrows schedule. We could use this information to take better economic decisions. It would mean changing a lot of places where 24h is hard coded.


### 15 Consolidate HourlyData and HourlyEvent

Why cant they be the same?

---

- Refactor all API endpoints to use dataclass-based serialization (with robust mapping for all field variants) for consistent, type-safe, and future-proof API responses. Ensure all details and fields are preserved as in the original dict-based implementation.

add power monitoring sensors to health check.

check if all sensors in config.yaml are actually needed and used (lifetime e.g.)

**
seems like sensor collector is using influxdb readings also for hourly updates instead of reading directly from the sensors.**

: Based on the code, hereâ€™s what happens:

The function _get_hour_readings in SensorCollector is called by collect_energy_data(hour).
collect_energy_data(hour) is not called every hour automatically by the system; it is called when the system wants to collect and record data for a specific hour.
The actual historical data for the dashboard is served from the HistoricalDataStore, which is an in-memory store populated by calls to record_energy_data (which uses the output of collect_energy_data).
So:

_get_hour_readings (and thus the InfluxDB query) is called at startup (to reconstruct history) and whenever a new hour is completed and needs to be recorded.
It is not called every hour by a scheduler, but it is called for each hour that needs to be reconstructed or recorded.
If you want to confirm when and how often this is called, you can add logging to collect_energy_data or _get_hour_readings.
