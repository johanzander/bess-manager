Advanced Flow-Based Decision Intelligence: Complete Specification
Context and Background
The System
We have a sophisticated Dynamic Programming (DP) battery optimization algorithm that controls a home battery energy storage system (BESS). The algorithm optimizes battery charging/discharging decisions over a 24-hour horizon considering:

Time-varying electricity prices (Swedish market: cheap night ~0.4 SEK/kWh, expensive peak ~1.5 SEK/kWh)
Solar production forecasts
Home consumption patterns
Battery constraints (capacity, power limits, efficiency, degradation costs)
Cost basis tracking (FIFO accounting for stored energy)

How DP Algorithm Works

Backward induction: Solves from hour 23 backwards to current hour
Value function: For each hour and battery state, calculates minimum total cost from that point to end of day
Optimal policy: At each decision point, picks action that minimizes immediate cost + future optimal cost
Mathematical optimization: Evaluates thousands of possible pathways to find globally optimal solution

Current Decision Output
The algorithm currently provides:

Hourly battery actions (charge/discharge power levels)
Energy flows between solar, grid, home, and battery
Basic "strategic intent" labels (GRID_CHARGING, SOLAR_STORAGE, LOAD_SUPPORT, etc.)
Economic results (costs, savings, efficiency metrics)

Current Problems and Limitations
1. Strategic Intent is Too Simplistic
❌ "GRID_CHARGING" - tells you what, not why or what's next
❌ "SOLAR_STORAGE" - doesn't explain the economic opportunity  
❌ "LOAD_SUPPORT" - doesn't show the multi-hour strategy
Problem: Users see the action but don't understand the sophisticated economic reasoning behind it.
2. Missing Forward-Looking Context
❌ "Why import expensive electricity at 07:00?"
❌ "Why store solar instead of using it immediately?"
❌ "Why discharge to both home AND grid simultaneously?"
Problem: Users can't see how current actions enable future opportunities or understand the multi-hour economic chains.
3. Insufficient Energy Flow Detail
❌ Current: "Battery discharged 3.2kW"
✅ Needed: "Battery 3.8kWh: 2.3kWh→Home (avoid 3.34 SEK grid cost), 1.5kWh→Grid (earn 2.03 SEK revenue)"
Problem: Users don't see the complex multi-destination energy flows and their individual economic values.
4. No Multi-Hour Strategy Explanation
❌ Current: Hour-by-hour actions without connection
✅ Needed: "Hour 02: Import 3.2kWh at 0.42 SEK/kWh → Export 18:00-19:00 at 1.45 SEK/kWh → Net profit 3.30 SEK"
Problem: Users can't see how the algorithm creates value through sophisticated temporal arbitrage strategies.
What We Want to Achieve
1. Complete Energy Flow Transparency
Show every energy flow with its economic value:
Hour 18: Complex Multi-Flow Optimization
├─ Solar 1.2kWh → Home (+1.74 SEK avoided grid cost)
├─ Battery 2.3kWh → Home (+3.34 SEK avoided grid cost)  
├─ Battery 1.5kWh → Grid (+2.03 SEK export revenue)
└─ Total immediate value: +7.11 SEK
2. Forward-Looking Economic Chains
Explain how current actions enable future opportunities:
🌙 Night Strategy Chain:
Hour 02: Import 3.2kWh at 0.42 SEK/kWh (-1.34 SEK cost)
→ Peak export 18:00-19:00 at 1.45 SEK/kWh (+4.64 SEK revenue)
→ Net 16-hour strategy profit: +3.30 SEK
3. Educational Understanding
Transform the system into an energy economics education platform:

Users learn about arbitrage opportunities
Understand solar time-shifting economics
See how batteries create value through temporal optimization
Build trust through algorithm transparency

4. Sophisticated Pattern Recognition
Replace simple strategic intent with detailed flow-based patterns:
Instead of: "DUAL_OPTIMIZATION"
Show: "SOLAR_TO_HOME_PLUS_BATTERY_TO_HOME_AND_GRID"
Explain: "Solar covers part of home demand while battery simultaneously supports remaining home load and exports excess for profit"
5. Decision Quality Assessment
Show how good each decision is:

Economic margin vs alternatives
Sensitivity to forecast errors
Opportunity score (how good the timing is)
Risk factors and dependencies

Why This Approach
1. Algorithm Determines Patterns During Optimization
Not post-processing: Capture decision reasoning when the algorithm actually makes the choice during value function calculation, ensuring accuracy to the mathematical optimization.
2. Finite Set of Describable Patterns
Finite battery actions → Finite energy flows → Finite describable patterns
Since energy can only flow between 4 components (solar, grid, home, battery), there's a complete, finite set of possible flow combinations that can all be given descriptive names.
3. Real Economic Education
Users learn actual energy market principles:

Temporal price arbitrage
Solar time-shifting optimization
Multi-destination flow optimization
Risk assessment and forecast sensitivity

4. Trust Through Transparency
When users understand the sophisticated economic reasoning, they trust the algorithm and learn to recognize optimization opportunities themselves.
